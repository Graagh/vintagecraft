=== Crafting Table ===

- Right click with piece of leather on log or stone to create a crafting surface



=== Metal System ====


- Each Ore has a description of its quality and stuff

- Ores: Tin, Copper, Iron, Gold, Lapis
- Alloys: Bronze, Steel

- Rare and Epically Rare Metals exist: http://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/the-worlds-10-most-precious-metals / http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_metal#Rough_world_market_price_.28.24.2Fkg.29
  Rhodium, Platinum, Iridium, Silver, Palladium, Osmium



- Better fuel = greater heat
- More fuel = greater heat

- Higher quality metal = requires more heat to melt
  
- Fuels: (http://www.earthlyissues.com/images/coal-formation.jpg)
  Wood/Peat = Food Cooking
  Charcoal = Melts Copper 
  Lignite = Melts Bronze
  Coal = Melts Iron
  Maybe Anthracite to melt rare metals



- Smeltings ores: Each ore require a different time to smelt

- Vanilla minecraft furnace 
  - Named Stove for cooking foods
  - Also melts copper
  - Uses 1 fuel at a time


- Furnace: 
  - Smelts most ores, 2 Block High
  - Top Block to add ores
  - Bottom Block to add fuel
  - Uses 3 fuel at a time


- Blast Furnace:
  - Made of rare fire clay (3 block high, 2x2 blocks width/length?)
  - Uses 5 fuel at a time


- Later version: Visualize liquid iron into molds


==== Rocks =======

- Soft stones (sandstone etc.) should be easier to mine


==== Rock Layers ======

- have thickness attribute instead of depthStart
- each rocklayer generates a green layer for thickness
- getRockLayerForDepth delivers correct rocklayer for coordinate

- use red layer (= just a blurred version of blue layer) for smooth transitions?!

===== Villages ====


Import schematic files: https://github.com/tehbeard/LibSchematic


- Villagers will buy and sell rare goods, which are often useless for the player.
  E.g. A fisher village sells pearls, a mountain village will sell gems
  => Players can establish trade routes between them

- A internal database of village and their type is kept. The further 2 specialized villages are apart the higher they will buy the others goods


- List of rare trade goods:
  - Any area:
    Jewelery  (sells jewelery, buys gems)
    Dyes (buys dyes, sells dyed cloth)
    Porcelain (buys clay, sells porcelain)
    Flowers (sells seed, buys peat)

  - Beach areas: 
      Pearls

  - Mountain areas:  
    - Gems (e.g. Emeralds)
    - Obsidian (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lipari-Obsidienne_(5).jpg)  - Lava creates perhaps a crappy obsidian? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian#mediaviewer/File:ObsidianDomeCA.JPG
    - Salt

  - Plains / Dessert:
    - Herbs / Spices (e.g. Peppermint, Pepper, Chilli)
    - Incense
    - Wine

  - Cold + Forest areas: 
    - Furs

  - Jungle areas:
