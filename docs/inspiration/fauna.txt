===== Animals ====


o Domesticated animals should no longer spawn.

o Instead only wild animals in their natural habitat (deer, foxes, bears in the forests, rabbits 
meadows and forests, etc.) spawn

o All wild animals are either dangerous or very shy and escape he player very quickly. Player has to sneak and carefully approach the animal to kill it. Ranged weapons help a lot.

o Animals therefore drop a lot more meat and leather

o Domesticated animals can be acquired through a long and expensive process








o Tamed Wolfs warn you off incoming dangers. Examples: Mobs that are targeting you or a new very dangerous mob

o Send tamed wolfs to catch small animals? ^_^
