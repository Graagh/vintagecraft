===== Villages ===

Generated just like trees, with just 2 changed rules:

- Roads are horizontal branches, growing outwards from a village center. Houses generate like the leaves of a tree

- Active avoidance of intersecting houses and roads with one another

- Occasionally branch off of a road to connect with another road



===== Villagers ====

Import schematic files: https://github.com/tehbeard/LibSchematic


- Villagers will buy and sell rare goods, which are often useless for the player.
  E.g. A fisher village sells pearls, a mountain village will sell gems
  => Players can establish trade routes between them

- A internal database of village and their type is kept. The further 2 specialized villages are apart the higher they will buy the others goods


- List of rare trade goods:
  - Any area:
    Jewelery  (sells jewelery, buys gems)
    Dyes (buys dyes, sells dyed cloth)
    Porcelain (buys clay, sells porcelain)
    Flowers (sells seed, buys peat)

  - Beach areas: 
      Pearls

  - Mountain areas:  
    - Gems (e.g. Emeralds)
    - Obsidian (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lipari-Obsidienne_(5).jpg)  - Lava creates perhaps a crappy obsidian? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian#mediaviewer/File:ObsidianDomeCA.JPG
    - Salt

  - Plains / Dessert:
    - Herbs / Spices (e.g. Peppermint, Pepper, Chilli)
    - Incense
    - Wine

  - Cold + Forest areas: 
    - Furs

  - Jungle areas:
    - Rum, Tobacco

  


- Sell stuff you cannot normally get to. E.g. Seed Vendor (sells seeds for flowers that don't or rarely grow in nature)
