=== Underground tweaks ===

- Make diamonds and emeralds spawn in clusters. (rnd pos around a center with 2-3 block radius)

- Add crystal caves, which are somtimes underwater, sometimes drained. Contains smoky quartz crystals, rose quartz crystals, gypsum crystals, etc.



== Blachsmithing system ====

- Creating tools/armor/etc. out of metal requires an anvil.

- Each item requires certain techniques in a specific order. Making a mistake will result in a "Oddly shaped ingot" which has to be resmithed into an ingot

- Ingots have to be hot to be workable. Requires a forge which however can be used from the same gui if a forge is nearby


- Blacksmithing is a skill, that with increasing profession increases the damage and durability of tools!




=== Metal System ====


- Each Ore has a description of its quality and stuff

- Ores: Tin, Copper, Iron, Gold, Lapis
- Alloys: Bronze, Steel

- Rare and Epically Rare Metals exist: http://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/the-worlds-10-most-precious-metals / http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_metal#Rough_world_market_price_.28.24.2Fkg.29
  Rhodium, Platinum, Iridium, Silver, Palladium, Osmium



- Better fuel = greater heat
- More fuel = greater heat

- Higher quality metal = requires more heat to melt
  
- Fuels: (http://www.earthlyissues.com/images/coal-formation.jpg)
  Wood/Peat = Food Cooking
  Charcoal = Melts Copper 
  Lignite = Melts Bronze
  Coal = Melts Iron
  Maybe Anthracite to melt rare metals



- Smeltings ores: Each ore require a different time to smelt

- Vanilla minecraft furnace 
  - Named Stove for cooking foods
  - Also melts copper
  - Uses 1 fuel at a time


- Furnace: 
  - Smelts most ores, 2 Block High
  - Top Block to add ores
  - Bottom Block to add fuel
  - Uses 3 fuel at a time


- Blast Furnace:
  - Made of rare fire clay (3 block high, 2x2 blocks width/length?)
  - Uses 5 fuel at a time


- Later version: Visualize liquid iron into molds
