==== Rocks =======

- Soft stones (sandstone etc.) should be easier to mine


==== Rock Layers ======

- have thickness attribute instead of depthStart
- each rocklayer generates a green layer for thickness
- getRockLayerForDepth delivers correct rocklayer for coordinate

- use red layer (= just a blurred version of blue layer) for smooth transitions?!



===== Soil System ======

- Acidity map:
  - Base value = Acidity of topmost rock layer
  - Account for Temperature. Higher temperature => stronger weathering => stronger base value
  - Account for Rainfall. More rain => more acid
  - Account for Vegetation. Heavy Vegetation => more acid


- Soil thickness map
  - Account for Elevation. Higher elevation => stronger rain runoff
  - Account for Age. Greater Age => thicker soil 


- Nutrient map (NKP)
  - Nitrogen: 
    - Base value = Rainfall. 
    - Account for Elevation. Higher elevation => stronger rain runoff
  - 




========= Cave Stuff =====

- Mineshafts like these http://imgur.com/a/idI07

  - Slopes
  - Domes
  - Steep near the surface
  - Lake
  - completely Submerged
  - Wet stone => make water drip
  - Spawners
  - Collapse of domes near surface = below sealevel vegetation
